Imported: 
   import tkinter as tk
   from tkinter import filedialog
   from PIL import Image, ImageTk
   import pytesseract
 
   tkinter: Imports the Tkinter library for creating GUIs.
   filedialog: Specifically imports the filedialog module from Tkinter, which is used to create file dialog boxes for selecting files.
   PIL: Imports the Python Imaging Library (PIL) modules for working with images.
   pytesseract: Imports the pytesseract module, which provides an interface to Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.

  Function Definitions:
   display_image(image_path): Displays an image specified by the 'image_path' parameter on a Tkinter label widget named 'image_label'.
   select_image(): Opens a file dialog box for selecting an image file. If an image is selected, it displays the image and updates the file path label ('file_path_label').
   perform_ocr(image_path, lang="eng"): Performs Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image specified by 'image_path' using Tesseract. It returns the extracted text.
   show_ocr_result(): Retrieves the selected image path and OCR language, performs OCR on the image, and displays the OCR result on a label widget ('result_text_label').

  GUI Setup Includes:
     root = tk.Tk(): Creates the main Tkinter window.
     root.title("OCR"): Sets the title of the window.
   For Widgets:
     "image_label", "file_path_label", and "result_text_label" are labels used for displaying images, file paths, and OCR results, respectively.
      select_button - button used to trigger the image selection process.
      ocr_button - button used to trigger the OCR process.
      language_var -  Tkinter variable used to store the selected OCR language.
      language_dropdown - an OptionMenu widget for selecting the OCR language from a dropdown menu.

  Event Loop:
      root.mainloop(): Starts the Tkinter event loop, which waits for user interactions and responds to events such as button clicks and window resizing.

 Overall Users can select an image file, choose an OCR language, and trigger the OCR process. The extracted text is then displayed on the GUI.
